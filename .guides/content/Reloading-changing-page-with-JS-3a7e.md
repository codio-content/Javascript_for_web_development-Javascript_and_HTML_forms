Here are two last very useful function for this unit.

First we have `window.reload()` which will reload the window, as if you had pressed the reload or refresh button.

Then we have the function `window.location.replace();`, we can call this function with an URL and the browser will navigate to that page as if you had entered an address in the top URL bar of your browser.

For example you could write : `window.location.replace('https://www.codio.com')` and the browser would navigate to Codio's website.

If we use `window.location.replace` we could add a click event and create a quick menu for our three pages
