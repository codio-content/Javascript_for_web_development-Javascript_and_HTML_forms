## Form mechanisms
What exactly did happen in our simple form in the previous section ?
In general, what happens when a user submits a form on a website? 

In the graphic below we see the steps:

1. You click on the submit button after having filled the textfield with "Your name"
1. The browser submits the form to the provided action URL.
1. The server processes the form data and answers with a page saying "Thank you for submitting your form to this address..." 

Normally for step 2. we must have a server with a script that processes the form data and answers with a page. This is not in the scope of this unit and is provided for you. Until the end of the unit, if you need an URL for the `action` property of your forms you can use `https://codio-forms-unit.com`.
