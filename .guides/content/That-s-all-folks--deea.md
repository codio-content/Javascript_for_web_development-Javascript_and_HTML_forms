In this unit we have seen how to build HTML forms and use them to transmit information from the user to the server. We then saw how exactly this information is transmitted.

Next we saw how to use form widgets with JS in order to interact with the user without using forms. We then saw how to use any HTML element as in interaction source.

Finally we saw how to use the hash parameters to have URLs which we can parse using JS and display different pages. We then saw how to build a menu that uses these URLs to navigate our example website.

Stay tuned for more advanced units about web development on the Codio platform.
